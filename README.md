# K-Means-
Implement k means from scratch python

# How does the kmeans algorithm work
### The kMeans algorithm finds those k points (called centroids) that minimize the sum of squared errors. This process is done iteratively until the total error is not reduced anymore. At that time we will have reached a minimum and our observations will be classified into different groups or clusters.

# Steps of K-means 
### 1. We initialize k centroids randomly.
### 2. Calculate the sum of squared deviations.
### 3. Assign a centroid to each of the observations.
### 4. Calculate the sum of total errors and compare it with the sum in the previous iteration.
### 5. If the error decreases, recalculate centroids and repeat the process.
### 6. Draw Elbow Grap
